# Fractured
Final GBA project for CS 2261. A tough Super Meatboy like platformer that also adds dimension shifting to the mix.

# Playing Fractured
Fractured is already built into a .gba file and ready to play. In order to play it, you must first download a Game Boy Advance emulator. I recommend [Visual Boy Advance] (http://www.emuparadise.me/Nintendo_Gameboy_Advance_Emulators/Windows/VisualBoyAdvance/86), however you are free to use any emulator you like. You can even play it on a real Game Boy if you have the necessary cartridge flashing hardware.
